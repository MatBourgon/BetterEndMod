# Better End

## Description

### Extra flavor!

Adds a new ore to the end: Fluorite! Used for creating the new Fluorite block, and fancy Warp Pads!

### Extra danger!

Adds a new creature to the end islands: The Chorus ENT. This creature is not fond of invaders, and will make sure they regret showing up.

### Extra fun!

Adds a new item: Vers Eye. This item is the heart of the Warp Pad.
Speaking of Warp Pads, have we mentioned warp pads? Linking warp pads is as simple as placing them down! To use them, simply eat a chorus fruit on the warp pad. If the teleport failed (nothing happened), then it failed to detect any warp pads (they have a range of about 40 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically). If two warp pads are within the same distance as a central pad, then simply look towards the target warpad while eating the chorus fruit (only applies horizontally).

### Extra... potion?

Adds a new potion and status effect: Attraction. Harness the power of the Chorus ENT by brewing a new potion with its eye! This potion will attract dropped items and XP from further away towards you. Mobs are not affected.
